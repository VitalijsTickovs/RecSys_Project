Calculating coverage for recommendation algorithms involves measuring the proportion of items in the entire dataset that are successfully recommended by the algorithm. For board game recommendation systems, item coverage can be calculated as follows:

### Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF):

1. **Calculate the Total Items in the Dataset (N_total):** Count all unique board games in your dataset.

2. **Implement the IBCF Algorithm:** Implement the item-based collaborative filtering algorithm to generate recommendations for users. For each user, predict the top N items they might like based on item similarities and past user behavior.

3. **Count Recommended Items (N_recommended):** Count the total unique board games recommended to users across the entire user base.

4. **Calculate Item Coverage for IBCF:** Item Coverage (IC_IBCF) is calculated as $\frac{N_{recommended}}{N_{total}} \times 100\%$.

### Content-Based Filtering (CBF):

1. **Calculate the Total Items in the Dataset (N_total):** Count all unique board games in your dataset.

2. **Create Item Profiles:** For content-based filtering, you need item profiles. These could include features such as game genre, complexity, theme, etc. 

3. **Implement the CBF Algorithm:** Utilize the item profiles to recommend board games to users based on their preferences and historical data.

4. **Count Recommended Items (N_recommended):** Count the total unique board games recommended to users across the entire user base.

5. **Calculate Item Coverage for CBF:** Item Coverage (IC_CBF) is calculated as $ \frac{N_{recommended}}{N_{total}} \times 100\% $.

### Comparing the Coverage of IBCF and CBF:

To compare the coverage of the two algorithms, you can use several metrics:

1. **Overlap:** Determine how many items are commonly recommended by both algorithms. Calculate the Jaccard similarity or the percentage of overlap between the sets of items recommended by IBCF and CBF.
   $$
   Jaccard\_Overlap = \frac{|IBCF\_Recommended\_Items \cap CBF\_Recommended\_Items|}{|IBCF\_Recommended\_Items \cup CBF\_Recommended\_Items|} \times 100\%
   $$

2. **Unique Coverage:** Calculate the percentage of items that are uniquely covered by each algorithm.

  $$
   Unique\_Coverage\_IBCF = \frac{|IBCF\_Recommended\_Items - CBF\_Recommended\_Items|}{N_{total}} \times 100\%
  $$

  $$
   Unique\_Coverage\_CBF = \frac{|CBF\_Recommended\_Items - IBCF\_Recommended\_Items|}{N_{total}} \times 100\%
  $$

3. **Combined Coverage:** Calculate the total coverage considering recommendations from both algorithms.
$$
   Combined\_Coverage = \frac{|IBCF\_Recommended\_Items \cup CBF\_Recommended\_Items|}{N_{total}} \times 100\%
$$

By using these metrics, you can assess how much content-based filtering contributes to improving the item coverage of item-based collaborative filtering. These comparisons will give you insights into the effectiveness of each algorithm and their combined impact on item coverage.
